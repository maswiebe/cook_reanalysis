This repository contains Stata .do files for performing a replication of "[Violence and economic activity: evidence from African
American patents, 1870â€“1940](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-014-9102-z)", Cook (2014).

The original data is included in the data folder, along with the raw [population data](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2002/demo/POP-twps0056.pdf).

To rerun the analyses, execute the Stata script `run.do`. 
Note that you need to set the path in `run.do` on line 8, to define the location of the folder that contains this script.
